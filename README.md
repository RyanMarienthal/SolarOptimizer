This project contains the design of a solar power optimizer.

The project was designed in KiCad, and the files are provided and can be edited to the users demands.

The project has generic values for R1, R2, R3, and R4 because they are intended to be chosen by the user depending on the voltage of the system.

Standard divider sizes are shown below:
  48V OCV: R1 = 40kOhm, R2 = 7500Ohm, R3 = 1000Ohm, R4 = 2000Ohm
  R1 and R2 must be rated for at least 1/8 Watt.
  R3 and R4 must be rated for at least 1 Watt.

  24V OCV: R1 = 16kOhm, R2 = 2000Ohm, R3 = Short, R4 = Open
  R1 and R2 must be rated for at least 1/8 Watt

Production files are aslo included, the zip file and BOM are formatted for JLCPCB manufacturing and assembly.

If another software is used, these may need to be altered.
